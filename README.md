# Unleashing Web Mastery from Front to Back
- This project is designed to assist with front-end development, providing a user-friendly interface similar to a word document. It simplifies the process, allowing users to build attractive front-end pages without learning complex code. By selecting function buttons on the website, users can easily create their own cool web pages.    
- In our future plans, we aim to expand the platform to help users build the corresponding back-end. This will enable seamless database calls and updates, offering a comprehensive solution for both front-end and back-end development.    

## The Origin of the Idea
This task is implemented in accordance with the Scrum methodology, with iterative updates and prioritization of requirements. With the emergence of ChatGPT, we can quickly obtain answers to questions without spending more time filtering through search engine results. In addition to this functionality, ChatGPT can also assist programmers in writing code and fixing bugs. Therefore, ChatGPT serves as a new way of searching and learning, saving time and providing concise and understandable results.   

Considering this, we are brainstorming the idea of establishing a website that integrates the knowledge required for front-end development. The goal is to enable people with zero knowledge to build their own front-end interfaces on a single website without the need to learn or write code. They only need to 'write' front-end page documents on this website.  

## Project Requirement (updating)
Front-end development is a popular career path due to its high demand and relatively quick learning curve compared to algorithms, for example. Our project aims to build a website with features similar to word document editing, helping users with zero knowledge autonomously create the UI interfaces they need and implement the functionalities they require. The most notable features of this website include:  
- Users do not need to understand front-end-related knowledge or code learning.
- Simple operations, as users only need to select various small functions needed to build the UI interface, similar to writing a word document in Microsoft Word.
- Integration of the three main front-end development languages, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, presented in the form of icon selections on the website, ensuring comprehensive functionality.

# **HTML Generation from Online Text Design Project**

**Time Period**: Sept 2024 - Present  

---

## **Project Overview**  

The **HTML Generation from Online Text Design** project provides a seamless solution for transforming user-designed PowerPoint content into HTML code. The system combines a robust backend, a dynamic frontend, and efficient caching and storage solutions to enhance performance and user experience.  

---

## **Project Requirements**  

### **User Requirements**  
- Allow users to design content in PowerPoint format and convert it into responsive HTML code.  
- Provide a user-friendly interface for content input and preview.  
- Ensure quick and reliable access to previously generated HTML content.  

### **Technical Requirements**  
- Build a scalable and efficient backend to handle business logic and API requests.  
- Implement a high-performance caching layer to improve system responsiveness.  
- Ensure data persistence with a reliable relational database system.  

---

## **Project Description (STAR Method)**  

### **Situation**  
Users often require a fast and accurate way to convert their PowerPoint designs into responsive HTML code for web integration. Existing tools either lack precision or are not user-friendly, prompting the need for a custom-built solution.

### **Task**  
My primary responsibilities were to:  
1. Develop a robust **backend** in Golang to handle business logic and API requests.  
2. Build a **React-based frontend** for user interactions, allowing real-time HTML preview.  
3. Optimize performance by implementing **Redis caching** for frequently accessed data.  
4. Ensure data persistence and reliability using **PostgreSQL** for storing user inputs and generated HTML.  

### **Action**  

#### **1. Backend Development**  
- **Challenge**: The backend needed to efficiently handle user requests, perform business logic, and generate HTML code.  
- **Steps Taken**:  
  - Developed the backend using **Golang**, focusing on clean architecture principles.  
  - Created API endpoints to handle user data input and HTML generation requests.  
  - Implemented robust error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.  

#### **2. Frontend Development**  
- **Challenge**: The frontend needed to provide an intuitive interface for users to upload PowerPoint designs and preview the generated HTML.  
- **Steps Taken**:  
  - Built the frontend using **React**, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.  
  - Integrated **real-time previews** of the generated HTML, allowing users to see changes instantly.  
  - Implemented state management to handle dynamic user interactions and updates efficiently.  

#### **3. Performance Optimization**  
- **Challenge**: To handle high traffic and ensure quick data retrieval.  
- **Steps Taken**:  
  - Integrated **Redis** as a caching layer to store frequently accessed data, significantly reducing database query times.  
  - Used **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage, optimizing table indexing and query performance.  

#### **4. System Integration and Testing**  
- **Challenge**: Ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend, and validating system reliability.  
- **Steps Taken**:  
  - Implemented thorough integration tests to verify the correct functioning of API endpoints.  
  - Conducted load testing to ensure system stability under high user traffic.  

### **Expected Result**  
- **Backend Efficiency**: The Golang backend efficiently handled user requests, reducing API response times <!--by **30%**-->.  
- **Frontend Usability**: Enhanced user satisfaction with a responsive React frontend<!--, leading to a **25% reduction in user drop-off rates**-->.  
- **Performance Gains**: Redis caching improved data retrieval speed, cutting load times<!-- by **40%**-->, while PostgreSQL ensured reliable data storage.  

---

## **Project Highlights**  

- **Full-Stack Solution**: Combined Golang backend and React frontend for a comprehensive and scalable application.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraged Redis and PostgreSQL for high performance and data reliability.  
- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on providing a seamless and efficient user experience with real-time HTML previews.
