# Unleashing Web Mastery from Front to Back
- This project is designed to assist with front-end development, providing a user-friendly interface similar to a word document. It simplifies the process, allowing users to build attractive front-end pages without learning complex code. By selecting function buttons on the website, users can easily create their own cool web pages.    
- In our future plans, we aim to expand the platform to help users build the corresponding back-end. This will enable seamless database calls and updates, offering a comprehensive solution for both front-end and back-end development.    

## The Origin of the Idea
This task is implemented in accordance with the Scrum methodology, with iterative updates and prioritization of requirements. With the emergence of ChatGPT, we can quickly obtain answers to questions without spending more time filtering through search engine results. In addition to this functionality, ChatGPT can also assist programmers in writing code and fixing bugs. Therefore, ChatGPT serves as a new way of searching and learning, saving time and providing concise and understandable results.   

Considering this, we are brainstorming the idea of establishing a website that integrates the knowledge required for front-end development. The goal is to enable people with zero knowledge to build their own front-end interfaces on a single website without the need to learn or write code. They only need to 'write' front-end page documents on this website.  

## Project Requirement (updating)
Front-end development is a popular career path due to its high demand and relatively quick learning curve compared to algorithms, for example. Our project aims to build a website with features similar to word document editing, helping users with zero knowledge autonomously create the UI interfaces they need and implement the functionalities they require. The most notable features of this website include:  
- Users do not need to understand front-end-related knowledge or code learning.
- Simple operations, as users only need to select various small functions needed to build the UI interface, similar to writing a word document in Microsoft Word.
- Integration of the three main front-end development languages, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, presented in the form of icon selections on the website, ensuring comprehensive functionality.
